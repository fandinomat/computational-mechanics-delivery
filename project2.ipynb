    "\n",
    "The differential equation for the SHO is $\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{k}{m}x$. Notice that the force depends on position here, not the velocity, like in project 1. This means Euler's method involves three calculations for each time step. A general time step will look like this:\n",

    "$x_{n+1} = ??? \\qquad\\qquad$                Find position at next time step from velocity in current time step (you need to fill in here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by defining the spring constant $k$ and the mass $m$. You also need to set up initial conditions as well as defining a time step size. Then you need to create arrays to hold the time, position and velocity values for every time point. Finally, you need a **for** loop to do the calculations for $a$, $v$ and $x$. Make sure you chose a final time that is enough for many oscillations to happen (about 10).\n",

    "After the calculation is done, plot the position $x$ of the oscillator as a function of time. Do you see a problem with it? \n",

    "Another way to see the same problem is by plotting the total energy of the oscillator ($T + V$) as a function of time. Calculate the kinetic energy ($T$) and the potential energy ($V$) for every time point in the motion. You can do this easily because Python interprets algebraic operations on arrays element-wise. For example, if $v$ is the array with velocitiess, the expression $0.5$ * $m$ * $v$\\**$2$ returns another array with the kinetic energy corresponding to each velocity element! Python is squaring each element in $v$ and then multiplying each result by $0.5$ * $m$. You can do a similarly easy calculation for the potential energy using the position array.\n",

This means that sometimes the error **increases** the velocity (or energy) a bit away from the true value and sometimes it **decreases** it a bit. Over time, these arrors mostly cancel out and the velocity, position and energy are always a little bit off the mark, but don't tend to run off wildly off mark.\n",

    "If you decrease the time step, the energy problem becomes smaller because the errors in each step become smaller. But you can never make the problem go away completely, you probably can see the energy still increase, albeit at a smaller rate. Try playing a little bit with the time step size and seeing how the energy plot changes.\n",

It uses the value of $a$ or $v$ on the \"*left*\" of the time step as an approximation for the whole time step. A good practice is to use a more \"*symmetric*\" method that takes into account the values of $a$ or $v$ on both sides of the time step."

    "Notice how you can also use this array as the input to the **for** loop! In this syntax, the value of the variable **om** will loop through all the elements of the array **oms**.\n",
    "##### Suggestion 4\n",
    "You should create an array to hold the values of the amplitudes. This array should have the same length as **oms**. At each iteration, after computing the values of $x(t)$, you should find the amplitude of the steady-state response and store it in the corresponding entry of the amplitudes array.\n",
    "##### Suggestion 5\n",
    "How to find the amplitude of the steady-state response? Here is one possible way. If you kept all parementers the same as they were for **part (a)** (except for $\\omega$), then you know that the second half of your $x(t)$ array is dominated by the steady-state response alone. You can select only this later part of your values for $x(t)$ by doing a Python *slice*. For example, if your $x$ array has 500 entries and you want to pick the last 200 of them, you can just do: **x[300:]** (notice the colon). This returns a new array with only the entries of the original array after entry $300$. \n",
    "##### Suggestion 6\n",
    "Now that you know how to slice your $x$ array, so that it contains only the steady-state response, one way to find the amplitude is to find the largest value in this new, sliced, array. You can do this with the Numpy function **np.amax()**. For example, **np.amax(x[300:])** will return the larges value in the array **x** but consider only the entries after $300$.\n",
    "##### Suggestion 7\n",
    "Don't try to create arrays for $x(t)$ for allvalues of $\\omega$. In the code below, I just re-define $x$ as an array of zeroes in each iteration of the outer for loop. This means you loose all the values for $x(t)$ you computed in the previous iterations. It doesn't matter, however, because we are storing the solutions amplitude at each iteration, which is what we are interested in.\n",

    "Here is the structure of a code to implement these suggestions (don't try running the cell below as it will probably give an error):"
